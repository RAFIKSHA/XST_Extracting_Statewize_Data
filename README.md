## Overview

This code is designed to perform analysis and generate visualizations for various aspects of India's state-wise data, including population, literacy rate, age group distribution, religious composition, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Splitting the combined 'State & District' column into separate columns for District_Code, State_Name, and District_Name.
- Calculating the total population for each state.
- Calculating the average literacy rate for each state.

## Data Visualizations

The code generates several visualizations, including:
1. Population distribution by state.
2. Distribution of the working population by age group.
3. Literacy rate variation across states.
4. Age group distribution.
5. Religious composition pie chart.
6. And more.
